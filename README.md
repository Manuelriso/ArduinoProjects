### 🔴 MyBlink

> 🧠 *My very first Arduino program ever.*

This was the first sketch I successfully ran on an **Arduino UNO** board when I was **15 years old**.

- **Board:** Arduino UNO / Elegoo UNO R3  
- **Default LED Pin:** `13`  
- **Blink Interval:** `100 ms`

#### 🚀 What it does
- Turns the LED on
